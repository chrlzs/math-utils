Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, and atan.

Floating-point representation functions: round (with optional decimal parameter), floor, ceil, and abs.

factorial(n): Calculates the factorial of a given number n.

gcd(a, b): Finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.

lcm(a, b): Calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers a and b using the formula (a * b) / gcd(a, b).

isPrime(num): Checks if a number num is prime.

fibonacci(n): Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.

nthRoot(number, root): Calculates the rootth root of a given number.

degreesToRadians(degrees): Converts degrees to radians.
